# DeepLearning-using-CNN
These are projects I undertaken to improve my understanding of CNN
1. Autoencoder.py - A CNN based autoencoder implimented on apples 
2. Cats and Dogs Classifier - A CNN based Classifier
3. Fashion MNIST - CNN based classifier to identify different clothing items from 10 classes. Several models are iteratively built and best is selected after analysing using tensorboard
4. Handwriting Recognition - CNN based classifier to identify hand written digits
